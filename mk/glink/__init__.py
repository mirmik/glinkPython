# Compatibility notes.
#
# All modules should be written primarily for Python 3 with basic Python 2.7
# compatibility kept in mind (but not at a cost of code readability or
# maintainability!). For more information please refer to the `mybuild._compat`
# module.
#
# In a nutshell, ALWAYS import the following at the top of all modules.
from __future__ import absolute_import, division, print_function
